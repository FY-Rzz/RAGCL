Source code for RAGCL in paper: 

**Propagation Tree is not Deep: Adaptive Graph Contrastive Learning Approach for Rumor Detection**

## Run

You need to compute node centrality with ```centrality.py``` to process your own data before running the code.

The code can be run in the following ways:

```shell script
nohup python main\(sup\).py --gpu 0 &
```
